Guidelines:
- Start each bullet with an action or outcome ("Added", "Enabled", "Improved", "Fixed").
- Prefer one bullet per change; merge tiny related tweaks into a single bullet.
- If a fix addresses a user pain point, mention the scenario instead of the technical root cause.
- Do not include internal code terms (e.g. class names, module names) unless they are visible concepts to users.
